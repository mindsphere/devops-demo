# DevOps Demo Agent

This is a sample showing how to onboard an agent and upload data (data points,
events, files)

The demo is based on the starter code generated by:\
https://github.com/mindsphere/mindconnect-nodejs

## Notes

It's required to create two assets for this to work:

1. The first Asset is the actual instantiation of the defined Aspects + Aspect
   Types, the type will be whatever Asset Type you defined earlier in the
   Asset Manager
1. The second Asset is the Agent, and must be of type `core.mclib`. We need to
   define all the Aspects again in the agent, and then need to map them to the
   actual values in the first Asset

Also note that files & events can be uploaded to any of the two Assets, which
seems a bit weird; the data points can *only* be uploaded to the Asset, so we
could end up in the situation that we have some uploaded data in the Asset
and other in the Agent.

Probably the best option is to keep everything in the actual Asset, not the
Agent. The Agent has other interesting data though, like the *Online Status*
