# DevOps Demo Agent

This is a sample showing how to onboard an agent and upload data (data points,
events, files)

The demo is based on the starter code generated by:\
https://github.com/mindsphere/mindconnect-nodejs

## Notes

It's required to create two assets for this to work:

1. The first Asset is the actual instantiation of the defined Aspects + Aspect
   Types, the type will be whatever Asset Type you defined earlier in the
   Asset Manager
1. The second Asset is the Agent, and must be of type `core.mclib`. We need to
   define all the Aspects again in the agent, and then need to map them to the
   actual values in the first Asset

The timeseries data in the MindSphere can be mapped from an agent to one or multiple
assets. This is useful for example in scenarios where you have e.g. an environment
temperature sensor data and you want to assign that timeseries to all the assets
which are in the room.

The files and the events don't require mappings and they can be assigned directly
to the assets.

It is in most cases the best option to keep everything in the actual Asset and
to not upload any data to the Agent. The Agent has other interesting data though,
like the *Online Status*
